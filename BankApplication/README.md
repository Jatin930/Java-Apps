In this project, I made a simple banking application that acts as a checking account. It utilized print statements, if/else statements, methods, loops, and more. Using these techniques, the bank program created allows the user to perform multiple functions:

1.    Check your balance

2.    Make a deposit

3.    Make a withdrawal

4.    View the previous transaction

5.    Calculate Interest

6.    Exit the application
